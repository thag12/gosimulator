Upon installing the app, always try to move it to system applications in order to give it priority. This will make the app work better and crash less.

Always remove the previous version completely and reboot before installing the update.


## Q&A

**Pokemon flee on the first throw, i spin the stop but no loot! Why?**

You are softbanned. Don't jump continents, or wait 6 hours logged out before you do. The app can take care of the softban if you have a pokestop nearby. The trick involves opening the pokestop, spinning it, and closing - do this around 40 times (if you are interested how it works).

**Will you make this app for my Apple or Windows phone?**

No.  There are no plans to make apps for these other platforms.

**Why does the app crash on startup?**

Intel based android phones are not supported.  Google your model if you are not sure before posting here for help.  Popular Intel based phones include the ASUS Zenfone series.   Currently there are no plans to support these phones.

**I am receiving errors, force closes, etc:**

Try these standard troubleshooting steps:

- Access settings, Apps, and select GO Simulator.
- Force Stop
- Clear Cache
- Clear Data
- Toggle Airplane mode
- Reboot Phone
- Remove / Reinstall latest version

 

**After a fresh install, tweak as few options as possible to start off.**

1. Access settings.
2. Access login info.
    - Add username, password, and select google account indicator if applicable.
    - For google, the full email address is needed.  Passwords are also CaSe sensitive. This means your username is YourMail@gmail.com and your password is yOuRpaSsSword12345
3. Click the back arrow.
4. Now access app settings.
5. Start at slow speed and use a pre defined route. 
     - Generally try to use the one closest to you to avoid jumping continents.
     - A good rule of thumb is to use a GPS spoofing app and go to the place you plan spoofing in the PoGO app itself before starting the app.
6. Test it out and make sure it works.  Now start adding additional options/tweaks one at a time.  Once you receive an error/issue, see if you can repeat it.  If you find a repeatable error, post in the thread your exact steps to make it happen.

 

*It is recommended to pretend you are flying on an airplane.  Jump to different locations by logging off and back on to the app based upon how long a typical commercial flight would take.*

 

### In Game Troubleshooting:

Make sure you can log out and back into standard PokemonGo App without any issues.

Make sure there is room for Pokemon and items.  After so much looting, everything gets full and you will need to clear it out.  Regarding Pokemon, there are some advanced individual settings that can be used to remove specific Pokemon to avoid manual effort.

You can always disable location on your phone, and log into the PoGO app to clear out your inventory and do manual micromanagement. Always check this before asking here - usually your bag or pokebag is full, or you have no balls. (Pun intended)

How do I get a route added?

At this time we are currently accepting new routes.  Please don't just pick your own city to be near you to lower your risk of getting your account banned, please pick a useful route with rare Pokemon spawns that you can’t just get anywhere.

 

Please follow these steps.  Yes, you actually have to make a complete route.  You cannot just post in here asking for one.  It takes time and patience to make a good route.

1. Go to http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/click-lat-lng-list/

2. Find your starting point and zoom in super close.  Note that the map legend shows you how long 5 meters is.

3. Next you will keep clicking steps as you make a long path through the area.  Each click needs to be 5-15 meters apart.

NOTE-Your goal is to click each step (coordinate) on the web page. It needs to be between 5-15 meters for each click (coordinate). Click a nice route through a city, including plenty of rare spawns and Pokestops.

4. Create a text file title using the naming convention City_UniqueLandmark_State_Country.txt and dump your paths long list of coordinates.

6. Open issue here with name [ROUTE] - NAME_OF_ROUTE and post txt file in.
